GaussianNB

real world application: Spam filtering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering) 
pro
- simple, fast
- small amount of training data
con
- naive (features independent)
why good candidate?

Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
real world application: 
pro
con
- can be complex
why good candidate?

Decision Trees
build a tree with input features. Walk down the tree to determine the output for a given input.
real world application: https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/nurse-managers/using-decision-trees-to-aid-decision-making-in-nursing/204292.article
pro
- human readable
- fast making predictions
con
- slow making model
- can overfit quickly

K-Nearest Neighbors
classify labels into K groups
pro
- effective for large training data
con
- need to determine K
- computation costs is quite high 

Stochastic Gradient Descent 
pro:
- Efficiency.
- Ease of implementation (lots of opportunities for code tuning).
con:
- SGD requires a number of hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter and the number of iterations.
- SGD is sensitive to feature scaling

SVM
real world application: https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Supervised-Learning-for-Document-Classification-with-Scikit-Learn
pro
- work well in high dimensionality space
con
- complex to choose right paramters?
- can be slow
